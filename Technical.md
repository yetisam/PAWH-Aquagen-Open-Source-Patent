## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### Field of the Invention

This invention relates to atmospheric water harvesting systems, specifically to passive devices that extract water from ambient air moisture without requiring external electrical power sources.

### Description of Related Art

Traditional atmospheric water generators typically require significant electrical power to operate compressors, refrigeration units, or heating elements. Existing passive systems often suffer from low efficiency and limited water output. There exists a need for an energy-efficient, passive atmospheric water harvesting system suitable for deployment in water-scarce regions, particularly areas lacking reliable electrical infrastructure.

### Problems with Prior Art

1. High energy consumption requirements
2. Complex mechanical systems requiring maintenance
3. Limited effectiveness in varying humidity conditions
4. High manufacturing and operational costs
5. Dependence on electrical grid infrastructure

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The Passive Atmospheric Water Harvester (PAWH Aquagen) is a novel system that extracts water from atmospheric moisture using entirely passive mechanisms. The invention utilizes a combination of:

- **Wind-powered air circulation** via whirligig mechanism
- **Passive air compression** through Venturi effect design
- **Thermal differential cooling** using material properties
- **Hydrophilic surface treatment** for moisture attraction
- **Biomimetic chamber design** inspired by natural structures

The system operates without external power, making it suitable for remote locations and developing regions where access to clean water is limited.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### Primary Components

#### 1. Vertical Pipe Assembly

**Structure:**
- **Inner pipe:** PVC construction with hydrophilic surface treatment
- **Outer pipe:** Aluminum construction for thermal conductivity
- **Insulation layer:** Air gap between inner and outer pipes
- **Dimensions:** [Specific measurements to be determined during prototyping]

**Function:**
The dual-pipe design creates a thermal differential where the outer aluminum surface cools through convection and radiation, while the inner hydrophilic surface attracts moisture from the passing air stream.

#### 2. Wind-Powered Air Movement System

**Components:**
- **Whirligig mechanism:** Wind-driven rotating assembly
- **Air intake:** Positioned to capture ambient airflow
- **Internal ducting:** Channels air through the system

**Operation:**
Wind energy rotates the whirligig, creating negative pressure that draws ambient air through the system. The rotating mechanism requires no external power and operates in minimal wind conditions.

#### 3. Passive Compression Chamber

**Design Features:**
- **Venturi effect channels:** Narrowing and widening passages
- **Beehive-inspired structure:** Conical/stepped layering
- **Internal funnel design:** Progressive compression geometry

**Mechanism:**
Air is drawn through progressively narrowing chambers, increasing velocity and decreasing pressure. As air expands in wider sections, temperature drops occur, promoting condensation.

#### 4. Moisture Collection System

**Components:**
- **Hydrophilic inner surface:** Treated to attract water molecules
- **Condensation channels:** Direct water flow to collection point
- **Collection reservoir:** Storage for harvested water
- **Overflow management:** Prevents system flooding

### Operating Principles

#### Phase 1: Air Intake
1. Wind rotates the whirligig mechanism
2. Negative pressure draws ambient air into the system
3. Air enters through optimized intake design

#### Phase 2: Compression and Cooling
1. Air passes through Venturi effect chambers
2. Velocity increases in narrowed sections
3. Pressure and temperature drop in expansion zones
4. Multiple compression cycles enhance cooling effect

#### Phase 3: Condensation
1. Cooled air contacts hydrophilic inner surfaces
2. Moisture condenses on treated surfaces
3. Water droplets form and coalesce
4. Gravity directs water to collection channels

#### Phase 4: Collection
1. Condensed water flows to collection reservoir
2. Air exits system through outlet ports
3. Continuous cycle operation during wind conditions

### Materials and Construction

#### Inner Pipe Assembly
- **Material:** PVC for corrosion resistance and cost-effectiveness
- **Surface Treatment:** Hydrophilic coating to enhance moisture attraction
- **Joining:** Sealed connections to prevent air leaks

#### Outer Pipe Assembly  
- **Material:** Aluminum for thermal conductivity and weather resistance
- **Finish:** Optimized for heat dissipation
- **Mounting:** Secure attachment points for installation

#### Insulation Layer
- **Type:** Air gap insulation

- **Ventilation:** Controlled air circulation in gap

#### Wind Mechanism
- **Materials:** Weather-resistant metals and polymers
- **Bearings:** Low-friction, maintenance-free design
- **Blades:** Optimized for low wind speed operation

### Advantageous Features

1. **Zero Energy Operation:** No electrical power required
2. **Passive Operation:** No moving parts except wind mechanism
3. **Scalable Design:** Modular construction allows capacity expansion
4. **Low Maintenance:** Minimal mechanical complexity
5. **Environmentally Friendly:** No chemical processes or emissions
6. **Cost-Effective:** Uses readily available materials
7. **Robust Construction:** Suitable for harsh environmental conditions
